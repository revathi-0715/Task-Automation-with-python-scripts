# Task-Automation-with-python-scripts
This project automates a small real-life task using Python, developed for the CodeAlpha internship.
1. Move all `.jpg` files from one folder to another.
2. Extract email addresses from a `.txt` file.
3. Scrape the title of a fixed webpage.

Each script demonstrates practical use of Python libraries like `os`, `shutil`, `re`, and `requests`, along with file handling and basic automation logic.
